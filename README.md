> **Internship Final Project @ Vaultofcodes+** 
> Developed by:  Kashish Bunker

Project Overview :

This is a beautifully designed, user-friendly To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app is optimized for personal productivity with support for task priorities, time-based reminders, and real-time clock functionality.

---

Features :

- Add tasks with a custom title
- Set task priority (High / Medium / Low)
- Set time-based reminders with AM/PM format
- Live clock that checks reminders in real-time
- Mark tasks as completed or delete them
- Automatically saves tasks using browser `localStorage`
- Clean, soft-colored UI for better user experience

---

Tech Stack :

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Storage**: Browser `localStorage`
- **No Backend Required**

---

 How It Works :

1. User enters a task name.
2. Selects priority and optional reminder time.
3. The task is added with priority colors and time.
4. When current time = reminder time, task is visually highlighted.
5. Tasks persist using `localStorage` even after refreshing.

---

 Use Cases :

- Personal productivity & task management
- Study planning for students
- Event or meeting reminders
- Home task tracking

---

 Advantages :

- Clean, responsive UI
- No login or internet required
- Real-time functionality
- Simple and accessible

---

 Limitations :

- Data is stored locally (no cloud sync)

- No sound or notification popups (yet)

---

 Future Enhancements :

- Add sound and browser notifications
- Cloud sync using Firebase or Node.js backend
- Mobile app version (React Native/Flutter)
- Multi-user task sharing
- Dark mode & theming options
